An analysis on Summer Olympic Games.

This project served as the individual assignment of [SD6105-Data Visualisation] course. The main goal is to analyze the factors contributing to a country's performance in the Summer Olympic Games, including GDP per capita, population, number of athletes sent, and host country effect. 

From the data explored, many insights were gained. Countries with GDP per capita below the world GDP per capita in 2024 (Approx. US$ 13.664) generally win fewer gold medals, while top performing countries are indeed wealthy. Additionally, larger population does not guarantee success.  
Countries that have sent more athletes generally win more gold medals, and some countries manage to be 'efficient' in converting participation to gold medals by sending fewer athletes. Host countries tend to experience 'home advantage' and generally rank high although gold medal dominance is not ensured. Additionally, the median of host gold medal share stands only at 9.8%. Strong correlations can be seen between these factors: total athletes sent-number of times hosted, total athletes sent-gold medals, number of times hosted-gold medals.
